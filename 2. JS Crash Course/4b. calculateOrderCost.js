/*
Write a function called `calculateOrderCost` that given a weight in pounds and a base price in dollars,
returns a total cost in dollars. The cost is comprised of the base price, shipping (3 times the weight),
and tax (1.08 times the base price)

Bonus: Round the price to two decimal places (I'll leave that one up to you!)
