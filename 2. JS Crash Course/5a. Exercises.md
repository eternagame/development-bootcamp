# Quick Exercises
* Write a function called `calculateOrderCost` that given a base price in dollars, a weight in pounds, and a number of items, returns a total cost in dollars. The cost is comprised of the base price, shipping ($5 plus 3 times the weight), and tax (1.08 times the base price).
    * Bonus 1: If the base price is over $30, shipping is only $3 plus 1.5 times the weight. 
    * Bonus 2: For 10-15 items, add a 10% discount to the base price. For 16-20, 15%. 21-30 25%. 50+, 40%.
    * Bonus 3: Round the price to two decimal places (look in the MDN docs for how to do this!)
* Write a function called `isUnlocked` that given a number of buttons pressed, a codeword (string), and whether or not it is a Tuesday, returns a boolean indicating whether the door is unlocked. The number of buttons pressed must be greater than 6, the codeword must be "hello", and it must be a Tuesday
