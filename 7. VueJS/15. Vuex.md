# Vuex

<!-- Vue typically works by having some state, which is used to create the view, which the user can perform actions on to update the state. -->

<!-- However, this doesn't scale well when considering multiple components share common state. Vuex allows us to create a global singleton for all
of our shared state that follows a slightly different pattern. -->

<!-- With Vuex, you have your state, which is presented as immutable to views.
Views can then commit mutations, which are methods that are able to change
the current state, or dispatch actions, which can perform asynchronous operations and commit multiple mutations -->
